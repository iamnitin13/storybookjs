# What is storybook?

    Designing and testing components is crucial to every application, but it can be difficult to view components in isolation. This makes it hard to design and test components, but with Storybook this is no longer an issue. Storybook makes developing, testing, and working with a component library so much easier. You can test complex actions and ensure your components are always working as expected.

# Getting started with storybook

`npm storybook init`

# Run storybook

`npm run storybook`

# stories, argTypes, .storybook directory
